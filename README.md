# d2r-reimagined-mod
The source code for the Diablo II Mod Reimagined.

Found on nexus mods here: https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game. We want to provide a fresh experience for players who have played Diablo II for years, while also providing a fun and engaging experience for new players.

Everything we do, regardless if that is the D2R Files themselves or any of the tooling we build, is open source. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod. We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its future.
